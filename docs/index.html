                    <p><i>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</i> makes a few adjustments to the original gameplay formula of the <i>Counter-Strike</i> series. Compared to <i>Counter-Strike: Source</i>, weapon damage models were rebalanced. There is improved bullet penetration through some walls, materials, and objects.

                <section id="development">
                    <h3><b>Development</b></h3><br>

                    <p><i>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</i> started off as an Xbox 360 port of <i>Counter-Strike: Source</i> by Hidden Path Entertainment. Seeing this as an opportunity to expand the franchise, Valve turned it into an entirely new game.</p><br>

                    <p>Jess Cliffe confirmed the title <i>"Global Offensive"</i> on the official Steam forums on August 11, 2011, while Valve later confirmed with its official announcement on August 12, 2011</p><br>

                    <p><i>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</i> uses the latest version of the Source engine and is not built off of <i>Counter-Strike: Source</i>. After the success of the previous game, Valve wanted the newest game in the franchise to cater to both the casual and competitive community by including a matchmaking system as well as support for dedicated servers.</p><br>

                    <p>Valve announced the beta would begin in October, but after receiving feedback from professional players who had been invited to playtest earlier versions of the beta, Valve decided to delay the beta. After addressing the majority of the issues the closed beta started on November 30, 2011 to a pool of around 10,000 select players. After almost a year of the closed beta, Valve opened the beta up starting August 14, 2012 to anyone who had pre-ordered the game.</p><br>

                    <p>As of yet, the console versions have not been updated and are extremely different when compared to their Steam counterpart. It is currently unknown whether or not Valve has plans for updating these versions.</p><br><br>

                    <h5><b>Post-release</b></h5><br>

                    <p>Valve is known for providing active support and continuous updates for its titles, and <i>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</i> is no exception. Since the beta ended, Hidden Path Entertainment have stopped its share of the development and Valve has taken over and provided countless updates to the game for everything from bug fixes and gameplay adjustments to new official content like an inventory system, the In-game Store, the weapon finishes, and even added support for the Steam Workshop to allow custom content. Major content DLCs known as Operations are released once several months, each lasting over several seasons, bringing in new permanent content as well as seasonal content.</p><br>

                    <p>In the "Hello CS" presentation in China, it was announced that the game's engine would be ported to Source 2 in Summer 2017 along with the addition of a new UI called Panorama, and a special modified version of <i>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</i> would be released in China, via Perfect World.</p><br>

                    <p>Since December 6, 2018, <i>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</i> has become completely free. However, in order to play at prime matches, you need to buy the game for 15$, or reach level 21. Players who bought the game before the update of December 6, 2018, received free prime status and in honor of this they were awarded a special medal named the Loyalty Badge.</p>

                    <p>Achievements are given for completing milestones or notable actions, such as getting 1,000 kills with a particular weapon, or getting four headshots in one round. There are five categories of achievements, progression in the completion of achievements in each category will award the player with medals that can be seen on the leaderboard during matches.
