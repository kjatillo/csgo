                            <p>At launch, <i>Global Offensive</i> had a total of 16 official maps: 8 updated classic maps, and 8 brand new maps for the Arsenal game mode. More maps were added to the game in later patches.</p><br>

                            <p>Bomb Defusal mode, also known as Bomb Scenario, is a gamemode available in all games of the <i>Counter-Strike</i> series. It is considered by the majority of the community to be the most popular and balanced game mode. For those reasons, it is usually the only game mode used for tournaments or other competitive matches, with all of the "Active Duty" map pool currently being defusal maps.</p><br>

                            <p>The current Active Duty map pool as of 2021 includes Dust II, Inferno, Nuke, Train, Overpass, Mirage and Vertigo.</p>

                            <p class="map-info-text">The map is a bomb defusal themed scenario in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. The Counter-Terrorists have two objectives: to prevent the Terrorists from planting the C-4 at either of the two chemical weapon stashes (Bombsites A or B), or to defuse the bomb after the Terrorists plant. The map appears to be based in the Middle East, similar to its predecessor Dust. Dust II is arguably the most popular and played Counter-Strike map and perhaps the iconic map of the franchise. It was reskinned in October of 2017, which was its first major change in CS:GO since being released.</p><br>

In the official Global Offensive version, the presence of the Separatist faction suggests that the map is definitely set in Italy, as evidenced by the signs written in Italian seen around the map. However, the separatist faction is also present in the Basque country of Spain and France, so it's plausible it could be there, too.<br><br>
                            
                            The map is loosely rectangular, with the Counter-Terrorists spawning on one corner of the map and the Terrorists on the diagonally opposite corner, and the two bombsites sitting at the other two corners.

It's route passes through the Next&trade; train hangar, a Russian railway company that has previously been known for backing corrupt agents from The Coalition for their own gains. The Balkans, a Terrorist faction previously known for their multiple successful operations, has arrived to trap the train station with explosives days before it's arrival. Intel suggests that the explosives did not manage to blow the entire station, but only managed to de-rail the nuclear train. On December 10th 2014, the terrorist group takes matters into their own hands and bring up a highly explosive C4 to destroy the place once and for all, but the Counter-Terrorists are here to stop the explosion and defuse the bomb.

The GSG-9 must protect a stalled military shipment on a canal overpass while the Phoenix Connexion can either attack the shipment head-on or attempt to destroy the overpass itself by bombing the pillar below.<br><br>

                            The Counter-Terrorists spawn in bombsite A, where the disabled cargo truck is located at. Meanwhile, the Terrorists' Spawn Zone is around the bottom of the canal.<br><br>

                            Bombsite B is located below the CT Spawn Zone and can easily be accessed from a stairwell. In here, snipers can easily guard here as a sniper nest is positioned towards the entire site.

Valve and Hidden Path Entertainment had refined the map's visuals and implemented small gameplay tweaks. For instance, the original versions of Mirage had textures similar to Italy. Later on, it was changed into a Dust-like setting.</p><br>

                            Near the Terrorist Spawn Zone, there is a ladder leading from the first playable floor to the second playable floor that appears to be inaccessible from the bottom. In <i>Global Offensive</i>, a teammate can boost you up by crouching below the ladder. Prior to <i>Global Offensive</i>, the ladder can still be accessed from the bottom without teammates by carefully jumping from nearby ladders laying on the floor.
